# This project contains the code for the developpment of a Tampa Bay Lightning Fan Page. This code contains some CSS and some HTML. A roster page with clickable images is being worked on with every player on the team. Currently we are using the NHL website but the ultimate goal is for each player to have its own page made by me! :). ]

# PLEASE NOTE THAT THE FILE NAMED ALe LIGHTNING CONTAINS ALL THE PCITURES! Thank you.
